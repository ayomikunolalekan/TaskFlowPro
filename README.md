A Task Manager which allows users to create, edit, view and delete their tasks.

## How to build or run the application
1. First go to the github repository and clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. After cloning the repository to your machine, install the dependencies/requirements using the command **pip install -r requirements.txt**  
3. Once all the dependencies/requirements have been installed, run the app using the command **flask --debug run**  

### Note: How to handle potential errors while running/building the application
After installing the dependencies and running the application, if you are being faced with an error, specifically either an import error or just an error in general, before trying out steps 2 and 3 of how to run or build the application, run this command: **pip uninstall -r requirements.txt**  
After running the command, and all the dependencies/requirements have been uninstalled, you can now proceed to run the commands in steps 2 and 3 above.
